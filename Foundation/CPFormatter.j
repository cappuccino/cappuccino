    @class CPFormatter
    @ingroup foundation
    @brief CPFormatter is an abstract class that declares an interface for objects that create, interpret,
           and validate the textual representation of cell contents. The Foundation framework provides two
           concrete subclasses of CPFormatter to generate these objects: CPNumberFormatter and CPDateFormatter.

           CPFormatter is intended for subclassing. A custom formatter can restrict the input and enhance the
           display of data in novel ways. For example, you could have a custom formatter that ensures that serial
           numbers entered by a user conform to predefined formats. Before you decide to create a custom formatter,
           make sure that you cannot configure the public subclasses CPDateFormatter and CPNumberFormatter to satisfy your requirements.

    Returns a Boolean value that indicates whether a partial string is valid.

    This method is invoked each time the user presses a key while the cell has the keyboard focus it lets you verify and
    edit the cell text as the user types it.

    In a subclass implementation, evaluate aPartialString according to the context, edit the text if necessary, and return
    by reference any edited string in aNewString. Return \c YES if aPartialString is acceptable and \c NO if aPartialString is unacceptable.
    If you return \c NO and aNewString is nil, the control displays aPartialString minus the last character typed. If you return \c NO, you can
    also return by reference a CPString object (in anError) that explains the reason why the validation failed; the delegate (if any)
    of the CPControl can then respond to the failure in control:didFailToValidatePartialString:errorDescription:.
    The selection range will always be set to the end of the text if replacement occurs.

    This method is a compatibility method. If a subclass overrides this method and does not override
    isPartialStringValid:proposedSelectedRange:originalString:originalSelectedRange:errorDescription:, this method will be called as before
    (isPartialStringValid:proposedSelectedRange:originalString:originalSelectedRange:errorDescription: just calls this one by default).

    @param aPartialString the text currently in the view.
    @param aNewString if aPartialString needs to be modified, upon return contains the replacement string.
    @param anError if non-nil, if validation fails contains a CPString object that describes the problem.

    This method should be implemented in subclasses that want to validate user changes to a string in a field, where the user changes are
    not necessarily at the end of the string, and preserve the selection (or set a different one, such as selecting the erroneous part of
    the string the user has typed).

    In a subclass implementation, evaluate aPartialStringRef according to the context. Return \c YES if aPartialStringRef is acceptable and \c NO if aPartialStringRef
    is unacceptable. Assign a new string by reference to aPartialStringRef and a new range by reference to aProposedSelectedRangeRef and return \c NO if you want to replace the string and
    change the selection range. If you return \c NO, you can also return by reference a CPString object (in anError) that explains the reason why the
    validation failed; the delegate (if any) of the CPControl can then respond to the failure in
