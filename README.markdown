Welcome to Cappuccino!
======================

Introduction
------------
Cappuccino is an open source framework that makes it easy to build
desktop-caliber applications that run in a web browser.

With Cappuccino, you don't concern yourself with HTML, CSS, or the DOM. You  write applications with the APIs from 
Apple's Cocoa frameworks and the Objective-J language.

System Requirements
-------------------
To run Cappuccino applications, all you need is a HTML5 compliant web browser.

You can develop Cappuccino applications with only a simple text editor on any platform.

If you are on a Mac, our integration with Xcode leverages the world-class visual development tools from Apple to create complex applications with minimal coding.

Node.js version alpha
------------------ 

There is currently an ongoing effort to switch JavaScript platform from [Narwhal](https://narwhaljs.org/) to Node.js.
To try the Node.js version, do the following:

1. Install Node.js and npm from the [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/).
  
2. Run `npm set prefix ~/.npm`. This will set the default install location for npm to `~/.npm`. The reasoning behind 
this is outlined in the section about permission issues below.

3. Add this line to your `.zshrc` or equivalent config file.
    ```bash
    export PATH="~/.npm/bin:$PATH"
    ```

4. Restart your shell.

5. Run `npm install -g @objj/cappuccino`.

6. Done! See below for basic usage.

### Permisson issues

By default npm uses `/usr/local/lib/node_modules` as the install location for globally installed packages. This causes
problems since users typically lack write permissions there. It is therefore recommended to either use a version
manager, or change npm's default install location manually (which is what we did above). For more details on how to do
this, see [this article](https://docs.npmjs.com/resolving-eacces-permissions-errors-when-installing-packages-globally).

### Basic usage

If the install succeeded you will be able to do the following to create a simple Cappuccino application:

1. `capp gen HelloWorld`
2. `cd HelloWorld`
3. `python3 -m http.server`
4. Go to `localhost:8000` in your web browser.

### Building Cappuccino from source

If you want to build Cappuccino from source you should clone the GitHub repository at 
https://github.com/cappuccino/cappuccino/ and checkout the `node` branch. Then you can use the command
`jake install` to install Cappuccino and its tools locally. 

To build from source, do:

1. `git clone https://github.com/cappuccino/cappuccino.git`
   
2. `cd cappuccino`
   
3. `npm install`

4. Make any desired changes to the codebase.
   
5. Make sure the environment variable `CAPP_BUILD` is set. This is done by adding the line
    ```bash
    export CAPP_BUILD="/path/to/cappuccino/build/directory"
    ```
    to your `.zshrc` or equivalent config file and of course changing the path to where you want to build Cappuccino.
6.  Run `jake install` to build and install Cappuccino.

Beware that building and installing Cappuccino from source will overwrite the binaries installed from npm. To undo this,
simply run `npm install -g @objj/cappuccino` again.

Getting Started
---------------
To write you first application, [download the starter package](http://cappuccino.dev/#download).

To try our new Node (alpha) version of the Cappuccino framework, [check the Node installation instructions](https://github.com/cappuccino/cappuccino/wiki/node)
