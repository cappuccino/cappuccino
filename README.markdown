Welcome to Cappuccino!
======================

Introduction
------------
Cappuccino is an open source framework that makes it easy to build
desktop-caliber applications that run in a web browser.

With Cappuccino, you don't concern yourself with HTML, CSS, or the DOM. You  write applications with the APIs from Apple's Cocoa frameworks and the Objective-J language.

Check out a [live demo of the widgets in Cappuccino](https://cappuccino-testbook.5apps.com/#ThemeKitchenSink)

System Requirements
-------------------
To run Cappuccino applications, all you need is a HTML5 compliant web browser.

Our tight integration with Xcode on MacOS brings the full power of visual Cocoa development to the web.

However, you can also work on other platforms using only a simple text editor.

Getting Started
---------------
To write you first application, [download the starter package](http://www.cappuccino-project.org/#download).
