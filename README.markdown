Welcome to Cappuccino!
======================

Introduction
------------
Cappuccino is an open source framework that makes it easy to build
desktop-caliber applications that run in a web browser.

With Cappuccino, you don't concern yourself with HTML, CSS, or the DOM. You  write applications with the APIs from Apple's Cocoa frameworks and the Objective-J language.

Check out a [live demo of the widgets in Cappuccino](https://cappuccino-testbook.5apps.com/#ThemeKitchenSink)

System Requirements
-------------------
To run Cappuccino applications, all you need is a HTML5 compliant web browser.

You can develop Cappuccino applications with only a simple text editor on any platform.

If you are on a Mac, our integration with Xcode leverages the world-class visual development tools from Apple to create complex applications with minimal coding.
