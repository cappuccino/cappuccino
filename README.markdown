Welcome to Cappuccino!
======================

Introduction
------------
Cappuccino is an open source framework that makes it easy to build
desktop-caliber applications that run in a web browser.

Cappuccino is built on top of standard web technologies like JavaScript, and
it implements most of the familiar APIs from Apple's Cocoa
frameworks.

With Cappuccino, you don't need to concern yourself
with HTML, CSS, or the DOM.

Check out a [live demo of the widgets in Cappuccino](https://cappuccino-testbook.5apps.com/#ThemeKitchenSink)

Follow [@cappuccino](https://twitter.com/cappuccino) on Twitter for updates on the project.

System Requirements
-------------------
To run Cappuccino applications, all you need is a HTML5 compliant web browser.

Our tight integration with Xcode on MacOS brings the full power of native Cocoa development to the web.

However, you can also work on other platforms using only a simple text editor.

---------------
To get started, download and install the current release version of Cappuccino:
