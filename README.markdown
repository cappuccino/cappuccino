Welcome to Cappuccino!
======================

Special event
-------------
Release 1.0 is scheduled for [CappCon 2018 on September 4, 2018 at Université de Liège in Belgium](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/CappCon/events/248886408).

Introduction
------------
Cappuccino is an open source framework that makes it easy to build
desktop-caliber applications that run in a web browser.


With Cappuccino, you don't concern yourself
with HTML, CSS, or the DOM. You rather write applications with the APIs from Apple's Cocoa frameworks and the Objective-J language.

Check out a [live demo of the widgets in Cappuccino](https://cappuccino-testbook.5apps.com/#ThemeKitchenSink)

For more information, see [the official website](http://cappuccino-project.org) and [the Github Wiki](https://github.com/cappuccino/cappuccino/wiki).

Follow [@cappuccino](https://twitter.com/cappuccino) on Twitter for updates on the project.

System Requirements
-------------------
To run Cappuccino applications, all you need is a HTML5 compliant web browser.

Our tight integration with Xcode on MacOS brings the full power of visual Cocoa development to the web.

However, you can also work on other platforms using only a simple text editor.

Getting Started
---------------
To get started, download and install the current release version of Cappuccino:

    $ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cappuccino/cappuccino/v0.9.10/bootstrap.sh >/tmp/cappuccino_bootstrap.sh && bash /tmp/cappuccino_bootstrap.sh

If you'd just like to get started using Cappuccino for your web apps, you are done.
