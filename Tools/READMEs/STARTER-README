Welcome to the Cappuccino Starter Package!

Included you should find the following:

1. Documentation
2. NewApplication
4. README

NewApplication is a stand alone Cappuccino application that you can use as a template to start building your own apps.  To get started, just open up NewApplication/index.html in your favorite web browser.  A great place to go from there is to read the "Downloading and Getting Started" tutorial found at http://cappuccino.org/learn/tutorials/starter-tutorial.php.  This will walk you through these initial steps as well as getting you to do a little coding. If you want to debug your application, try running it with index-debug.html instead, which should make it easier.

You can build your entire application right from either of these sample projects, but if you want to dig a little deeper, you can also download the Tools package found at http://cappuccino.org/download/.  This will set you up with some great additions like syntax modules for certain text editors and build tools to get extra performance.

NOTE: If you'd like to make a nib-based application (so you can create your interface in Interface Builder), you will need to install the Cappuccino tools. Information is avaiable on our website, cappuccino.org/download
