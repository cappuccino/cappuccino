.Sh "DESCRIPTION"
.\"-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
.Nm
converts an Interface Builder file into a Cappuccino cib file that can be loaded
into a Cappuccino application.
.Pp
There are two main converting modes in which nib2cib can be used:
.Sy watch mode
and
.Sy single mode.
.\"-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
.Ss "Watch Mode"
.\"-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The easiest way to use nib2cib is in
.Sy watch mode.
This is done by using the syntax:
.Pp
.D1 nib2cib --watch [options] Op Pa directory
.Pp
If
.Ar directory
is omitted, a "Resources" directory in the current working directory is watched,
and if no "Resources" directory exists, the current working directory is watched.
.Pp
If
.Ar directory
is passed, is not a path to a "Resources" directory, and there is a "Resources" directory
within
.Ar directory ,
then that "Resources" directory is watched. Otherwise
.Ar directory
is watched. This allows you to pass the path to your application directory instead
of its "Resources" directory.
.Pp
In watch mode,
.Nm
goes into an infinite loop and monitors the watched directory for changes to xib/nib
files. There are three types of changes
.Nm
will respond to:
.Bl -tag -hang
.It add, modify
When a new xib/nib file is detected or an existing xib/nib file is modified, it is converted into
a cib file with the same base name.
.It delete
When a xib/nib file is deleted, the corresponding cib file is deleted as well.
.El
.Pp
Ordinarily in watch mode
.Nm
will only display a log line for each file that is added, modified or deleted, and a confirmation
when the corresponding cib has been generated or deleted. You can use the
.Fl v
option in watch mode to display more detailed information when a cib is generated.
.\"-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
.Ss "Single Mode"
.\"-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In
.Sy single mode,
you convert a single file xib/nib file into a cib. The only advantages of using single mode over
watch mode are:
.Bl -bullet -width 1n
.It
You may want to view verbose output temporarily to debug the conversion, or use different
options for different source files.
.It
You can specify an output name that is not based on the input name.
.El
.Pp
Most of the time watch mode will be sufficient, but if you do need to use single mode,
.Nm
tries to make it as easy as possible.
.Pp
If you navigate to your application directory and invoke:
.Pp
.D1 nib2cib
.Pp
this will look for "MainMenu.xib" or "MainMenu.nib" in the current directory and then in a "Resources"
directory within the current directory, if such a directory exists. Since these are
the default names used in Cappuccino, this usage covers the default case with no extra work.
.Pp
If your xib/nib file is not named "MainMenu.xib" or "MainMenu.nib", or you want to run
.Nm
from a directory other than the application directory or its "Resources" directory,
you can specify an input path:
.Pp
.D1 nib2cib Pa path
.Pp
Note that
.Pa path
does not need the ".xib" or ".nib" extension, since that is assumed. If you were to invoke:
.Pp
.D1 nib2cib foo
.Pp
this would look for "foo.xib" and "foo.nib" in the current directory and in a "Resources" directory
within the current directory. The output of nib2cib in this case would be "foo.cib" in
the same directory as the source file.
.Pp
If you want
.Nm
to generate a cib file with a different base name or in a different directory than
the input file, you may also specify an output path:
.Pp
.D1 nib2cib Pa input Pa output
.Pp
As with input filenames, you do not need to add the ".cib" extension to the output path,
this is assumed.
.\"-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
.Ss "Themes"
.\"-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To do its conversions accurately, 
.Nm
needs to access the themes you use. If you are using the standard Aristo theme, there is
nothing extra to do.
.Pp
If you are using a custom default theme, usually you specify this using a 
.Ar CPDefaultTheme
item in your application's Info.plist. In this case 
.Nm
will read the theme name from the Info.plist. If you set the default theme programmatically
and not in the Info.plist, then you should use the
.Fl \-default-theme
option to specify the theme name.
.Pp
If you are loading additional themes in your code using:
.Pp
.D1 [[CPThemeBlend alloc] initWithContentsOfURL:]
.Pp
then you should inform
.Nm
about it by passing the theme names as 
.Fl \-theme Ar name
options, one for each theme that you load.
.Pp
Themes are searched for in the Resources, $CAPP_BUILD/Debug and
$CAPP_BUILD/Release directories.
.\"-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
.Sh "COMMON OPTIONS"
.\"-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The following options are available in watch mode or single mode:
.Bl -tag -width 4n
.It Fl v, \-verbose
Displays more information about the internal workings of nib2cib. This can be set multiple
times to increase the amount of information displayed. If passed once, general information
is displayed. If passed more than once, detailed information about individual view conversions
is displayed.
.It Fl R Pa path
NOTE: This option is for the most part no longer necessary.
.Pp
Specifies the path (relative or absolute) to a directory from which images 
and custom themes are retrieved. Formerly
it was necessary to use this when your xib/nib contained references to images, but now
.Nm
infers the "Resources" directory from the input file, so usually you will not need to use
this option.
.It Fl \-default-theme Ar name
Specifies the name of the default theme used by your application. This is only necessary
if you are not using Aristo and you have not specified the default theme in your application's
Info.plist. For more information see
.Sy Themes
above.
.It Fl t, \-theme Ar name
Specifies the name of an additional theme to load. May be used multiple times. For more
information, see
.Sy Themes
above.
.It Fl \-config Pa path
Specifies the path to an Info.plist file from which to read configuration information about
your application, such as the system font and default theme. Ordinarily you do not need to
use this option, as
.Nm
uses the Info.plist in the application directory, which is inferred from
the input file.
.It Fl \-quiet
Tells 
.Nm
to output nothing. This is useful if you are using 
.Nm
in a shell script and are only interested in the return value.
.It Fl \-version
Prints the current version of
.Nm
and immediately exits.
.Nm
in a shell script and are only interested in the return value.
.It Fl h, \-help
Displays 
.Nm
usage and options.
.It Fl F
Specify the URL of a framework to load before converting. How this is useful is not actually
known at this time.
.El
.\"-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
.Sh "RETURN VALUES"
.\"-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
.Nm
returns 0 for a successful conversion and >0 if an error occurred.
