NAME
    fontinfo -- retrieve information about a font

SYNOPSIS
    fontinfo [-n] font [size]

DESCRIPTION
    fontinfo is a tiny utility that returns information about a font.
    The font name must be a full PostScript name, not a display name. So you would use something
    like "LucidaGrande-Bold", not "Lucida Grande Bold". The size can be any floating point number
    greater than zero. If no size is given, it defaults to 12.

    If the -n option is passed, the output will not be terminated with a linefeed.

EXIT STATUS
    fontinfo exits with a return status of zero if there are no errors.
    fontinfo exits with a return status of 1 if any arguments are invalid, or a status of 2 if the font
    cannot be found.

OUTPUT
    fontinfo outputs a stringified JSON object with the following structure:

    {
        familyName: <string>,
        bold: <boolean>,
        italic: <boolean>,
        ascender: <float>,
        descender: <float>,
        line-height: <float>
    }

    If -n is not passed, the JSON is terminated with a linefeed. The fields of the object are as follows:

    familyName: The display name of the font's family
    bold: Whether the font's stylistic traits are considered bold
    italic: Whether the font's stylistic traits are considered italic
    ascender: The offset from the baseline in points (not pixels!) of the longest ascender of the given font at
              the given size.
    descender: The negative offset from the baseline in points (not pixels!)
               of the longest descender of the given font at the given size.
    lineHeight: The height in points (not pixels!) of the largest glyph in the given font at the given size.
                Note that glyphs include diacritical marks that may appear above and below the largest ascender
                and descender, so the line height will almost always be greater than ascender + descender.
